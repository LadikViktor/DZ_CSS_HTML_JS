    <h1>Vehicle</h1>
    <div>
        <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum <span id="qw"><sup>[1]</sup></span>) is a machine that transports
            people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons,</p>
        <p>bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed
            vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships,</p>
        <p>boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft),
            aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and</p>
        <p>spacecraft.<span id="qw"><sup>[2]</sup></span></p>
        </br>

        <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:
        </p>
        <p>wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation,
            for</p>
        </p>road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<span id="qw"><sup>[3]</sup></span></p>
